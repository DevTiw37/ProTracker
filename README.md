# ProTracker

The ProTracker website is a simple tool designed to help users track their productivity levels over time. Users can select a productivity level from a range of 1 to 5 and record the current time and date of their productivity. The website displays a list of the most recent productivity entries, including the productivity level and the corresponding timestamp. 

Users can also delete individual entries from the list as needed. The productivity entries are saved locally in the browser's storage using JavaScript's localStorage API, allowing users to close the website and return later to view their previously recorded productivity levels.

Additionally, the website provides two additional features: exporting the productivity entries to an Excel file and copying the entries to the clipboard. The "Export to Excel" button generates a downloadable Excel file that contains the your productivity entries, enabling users to store and analyze their productivity data offline. The "Copy to Clipboard" button allows users to easily copy the productivity entries in a tab-separated format to the clipboard for further use.

The  ProTracker website is designed to allow users to conveniently track and manage their productivity levels on both desktop and mobile devices.
